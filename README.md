# 🌿 Skin Care Product Recommendation  

This **Machine Learning** project recommends **skin care products** based on a user's **skin type and conditions**. The model analyzes skin attributes to suggest suitable products, enhancing personalized skincare routines.  

## 📌 Project Overview  

- Developed a **recommendation system** for skincare products based on user **skin type and conditions**.  
- Used **synthetic data** generated by **AI** to simulate real-world skincare preferences.  
- Balanced the dataset and introduced meaningful patterns to improve model performance.  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)  
- **Machine Learning Models** (Classification & Recommendation)  
- **Data Preprocessing** (Balancing, Feature Engineering)  

## 📊 Data & Methodology  

- **Synthetic dataset** created based on real-world skin characteristics.  
- The original dataset was **imbalanced**, requiring **data balancing** techniques.  
- Identified **hidden patterns** between skin conditions and suitable products.  

## 🚀 Key Features  

✅ **Predicts** suitable skincare products based on user input.  
✅ **Handles imbalanced data** with preprocessing techniques.  
✅ **Uses AI-generated data** to simulate real-world scenarios.  
✅ **Scalable approach** for future integration into skincare apps.  

## 🔥 How to Use  

- Clone the repository:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skincare-recommendation.git
  ```
- Install dependencies:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Run the model script or Jupyter notebook to test predictions.  

## 📝 Future Improvements  

🔹 Integrate real-world user feedback for better accuracy.  
🔹 Expand recommendations to **ingredients-based** skincare routines.  
🔹 Develop an interactive **web app** for user-friendly predictions.
